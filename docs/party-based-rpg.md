# Party-Based RPG

* From its inception, this 3D version of CompuQuest has been party-based
* The main reason is most versions of CompuQuest have been party-based
* I don't generally like or play party-based RPGs
* When it comes down to it, I don't enjoy managing a party
* All this time, the only reason I was stomaching a party-based system was because I had found clever ways to minimize the things I don't like about party-based games
* Even when packaged in a form that is easier for me to swallow, there's still not much I like about party-based gaming
* I think the only thing I liked about party-based gaming is how it provided a sense of being amongst friends without much spatial investment
  * The main alternative for providing this sense of friendship is having AI characters following the player around, which is fun but expensive and brittle to implement
* The foundation of anything I create needs to be composed of elements that are robust and work well even when they are handicapped
  * A pro athlete is an athlete that has a skill buffer, so that even on a bad day he still performs well
* CompuQuest has the potential to be a stepping stone to revisiting the Marloth game, and being party-based is the main discrepancy that would cause problems in CompuQuest being a foundation for Marloth
* It's interesting to note that while being party-based has been one of the Essential Core Concepts from the beginning, it was never one of the High Level Requirements and all of the High Level Requirements can be met without party-based gaming
