# CompuQuest Design
## Story

* Satire
* Minimally Epic
* Zany
* Mind-bending

## Core Concepts

### Essential Concepts

* RPG
* First person
* Real time
* Simple graphics
* Relatively simple systems for equipment, abilities, and character creation
* Merged race and class
  * Instead there will be a tag system and each character template will have any number of tags defining and categorizing that character
* No procedurally generated architecture
  * The world will be static, though I'm open to the possibility of different versions of locations getting swapped out based on game state
* Relatively small, dense world with each zone crammed next to each other
* Some key aspects of the world can be randomized each playthrough
  * This may be kept to a minimum

### Fairly Certain Concepts

### Less Certain Concepts

* [Interaction Using Commands](#interaction-using-commands)
* [Dialog in 3D Space](dialog-in-3d-space)

## Concepts

### Interaction Using Commands

#### Motivation

* Equip the player with a collection of social tools that the player can own and master
* Move away from hard-coded dialog trees where the player is essentially filling out a form
* Use these social tools as a means of distinguishing character builds

#### Details

* Each player can acquire and upgrade commands for his character

### Dialog in 3D Space

#### Motivation

* Avoid modal dialog
* Allow spatial composition
* Mostly replace traditional shooting with diplomacy
* Unlike shooters, increased interaction and side-effects between nearby NPCs
* A cleaner model for enemies being pacified instead of terminated
  * I've always wrestled with both the moral implications and game mechanics of how the traditional shooter method of neutralizing a threat is by killing them, and all of my solutions toward mitigating this have always been weak—until this solution
    * The issue with killing game mechanic-wise is it is so boolean and normally permanent
      * It means most matches between a single enemy have little continuity—you kill an enemy and never fight them again
