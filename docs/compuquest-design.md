## Story

* Satire
* Minimally Epic
* Zany
* Mind-bending

## Core Concepts

### Essential Concepts

* RPG
* First person
* Real time
* Simple graphics
* Relatively simple systems for equipment, abilities, and character creation
* Merged race and class
  * Instead there will be a tag system and each character template will have any number of tags defining and categorizing that character
* No procedurally generated architecture
  * The world will be static, though I'm open to the possibility of different versions of locations getting swapped out based on game state
* Relatively small, dense world with each zone crammed next to each other
* Some key aspects of the world can be randomized each playthrough
  * This may be kept to a minimum

### Fairly Certain Concepts

### Less Certain Concepts

* [Interaction Using Commands](#interaction-using-commands)

## Concepts

### Interaction Using Commands

#### Motivation

* Equip the player with a collection of social tools that the player can own and master
* Move away from hard-coded dialog trees where the player is essentially filling out a form
* Use these social tools as a means of distinguishing character builds

#### Details

* Each player can acquire and upgrade commands for his character

### Dialog in 3D Space

#### Motivation

* Avoid modal dialog
* Allow spatial composition
* Mostly replace traditional shooting with diplomacy
* Unlike shooters, increased interaction and side-effects between nearby NPCs
* A cleaner model for enemies being pacified instead of terminated
  * I've always wrestled both with both the moral implications and game mechanics of how the traditional shooter method of neutralizing a threat is by killing them, and all of my solutions toward mitigating this have always been weak—until this solution
    * The issue with killing game mechanic-wise is it is so boolean and normally permanent
      * It means most matches between a single enemy have little continuity—you kill an enemy and never fight them again

## NPC Types

### Grunt

* General character
* Temporary until enough richer NPC types exist
* Attacks enemies

### Firebrand

* Incites nearby characters to view its enemies as their enemies
* Has an increased tendency to view everyone as an enemy
* Does not attack

### Bouncer

* Maintains a force field that prevents enemies from drawing near it
* Does not attack

### Peacemaker

* Causes nearby characters to be more friendly to other characters
* This aura provides a stronger friendship bonus toward the peacemaker's friends
* Attacks enemies
  * I think this is a healthy balance in showing that making peace is more than just being nice
  * "Negotions have gone out the window"

### Scout

* Reveals location of nearby characters to allies
* Attacks enemies
