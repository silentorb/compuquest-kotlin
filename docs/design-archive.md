* Pok√©mon-style collecting
  * How would this work?
    * Intuitively it feels like this mechanic should work but I don't know how it would actually integrate into the rest of the game
* How to handle swapping out party members?
  * I generally dislike swapping party members
    * It feels like I'm losing out on any investment I put into the character
    * It makes the characters feel fake like I'm hanging them in the closet to wait until I select them again.

* Heavy reliance on limited resources
  * Adds some valuable things
    * Depth to game mechanics
    * Encourages strategy
    * Enhances the retro adventuring feel
  * Cons
    * Requires a lot of investment and focus in terms of design and development
    * Adds restrictions to neighboring mechanics and systems
    * Can easily break the game and make it no fun
