# Design Archive

* Pok√©mon-style collecting
  * How would this work?
    * Intuitively it feels like this mechanic should work but I don't know how it would actually integrate into the rest of the game
* How to handle swapping out party members?
  * I generally dislike swapping party members
    * It feels like I'm losing out on any investment I put into the character
    * It makes the characters feel fake like I'm hanging them in the closet to wait until I select them again.

* Heavy reliance on limited resources
  * Adds some valuable things
    * Depth to game mechanics
    * Encourages strategy
    * Enhances the retro adventuring feel
  * Cons
    * Requires a lot of investment and focus in terms of design and development
    * Adds restrictions to neighboring mechanics and systems
    * Can easily break the game and make it no fun

### Strategy Distinction

* CompuQuest is a true strategy RPG
  * It is not a 4X strategy game with RPG elements
  * It is an RPG with a focus on strategy.
  * It has minimal tactics
    * Most labeling of games as "strategy RPGs" involves confusing strategy and tactics

## NPC Types

### Grunt

* General character
* Temporary until enough richer NPC types exist
* Attacks enemies

### Firebrand

* Incites nearby characters to view its enemies as their enemies
* Has an increased tendency to view everyone as an enemy
* Does not attack

### Bouncer

* Maintains a force field that prevents enemies from drawing near it
* Does not attack

### Peacemaker

* Causes nearby characters to be more friendly to other characters
* This aura provides a stronger friendship bonus toward the peacemaker's friends
* Attacks enemies
  * I think this is a healthy balance in showing that making peace is more than just being nice
  * "Negotions have gone out the window"

### Scout

* Reveals location of nearby characters to allies
* Attacks enemies
